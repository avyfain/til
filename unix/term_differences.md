# Difference between a 'terminal', a 'shell', a 'tty' and a 'console'

A terminal is at the end of an electric wire, a shell is the home of a turtle, tty is a strange abbreviation and a console is a kind of cabinet.

In unix terminology, the short answer is that

* terminal = tty = text input/output environment
* console = physical terminal
* shell = command line interpreter
